                Browser Flight Data Recorder is a firefox extension to automatically download web pages you visited.
                This extension takes snapshots of HTML when you leave web pages.
                Downloaded HTML files include form data, for example, search words in search engine page.
                Additionly, you can save each HTTP communication comprising HTTP headers and bodies of request and
                response.
                Snapshots of HTML and captured HTTP communications are downloaded automatically, without any clicks.

            <p>
                A file of a snapshot of HTML is divided into two sections, Browoser Flight Data Recorder header and HTML
                content.
                Browoser Flight Data Recorder header includes meta information of the snapshot of HTML.
                HTML content is a snapshot of webpage.
                Two sections are divided by \n(new line character).
                A captured HTTP communication file id divided into five sections, Browoser Flight Data Recorder header,
                HTTP request header, HTTP
                request body, HTTP response header, and HTTP response body.
                Two sections are separated by \n (new line character).

                        The major version increases when the compatibility of output files is lost.
                        The minor version increases when new functions are released.
                        The patch version increases when bugs are removed.
